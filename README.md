# ProgrammingForEverbodyWithPython
Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) Coursera Course given by Prof. Dr. Charles Severance, University of Michigan

I have tried to share my course notes, homeworks, assignments etc in this repository. I would like to help out everyone interested in that area.

Please note that all codes written here are compiled by Python 2.* version. In otherwords, if you try those codes in your own environment, it should have Python 2. By making some small changes, you can adopt to Python 3.

I hope this will be informative and beneficial for you.
Have a great day.
