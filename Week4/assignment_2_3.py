#2.3 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using raw_input to compute gross pay. 
#Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 96.25). 
#You should use raw_input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. 
#Do not worry about error checking or bad user data.

hrs = float(raw_input("Enter Hours:"))
rate = float(raw_input("Enter Rate per Hours:"))

pay = hrs*rate
print pay

#Output
96.25
